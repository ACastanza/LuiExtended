## Module / Component Contributions
- Combat Text: This module was originally sourced from Combat Cloud by Samantha James (Sideshow <esoui.com>). The vast majority of the code is written by Sideshow and has been updated with new features and implemented into LuiExtended. Thanks to Sideshow for the incredible Combat Cloud addon!
- Combat Info: Crowd Control Tracker: I received permission from dorrino from <esoui.com> to update and implement the features of Miat's CC Tracker into LuiExtended. Big thanks to dorrino for providing an excellent addon and saving me a ton of time trying to write my own component when a great addon like this already existed.

## Translation

## Other Addons

- Foundry Tactical Combat (FTC): Spellbuilder used inspiration for the buffs & debuffs and player frames from Atropos' FTC addon in the initial development process of LuiExtended.
