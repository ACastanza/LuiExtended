LUI Extended is an AddOn that adds multiple custom components including
- **Buff & Debuff Tracking** Track buffs and debuffs with new custom icons and significant enhancements to auras done by using a manual override table.
- **Chat Announcements** Display messages in chat when spending or receiving currency, track loot, achievements, experience gain, social events, guild invites, quests, and much more.
- **Combat Info** Track your GCD, Ultimate Value, Quickslot Cooldown and Highlight Active Abilities on your bar.
- **Combat Text** Display your outgoing and incoming damage/healing, track crowd control, track incoming damaging abilities with a new warning system, and monitor your resource gain.
- **Slash Commands** Adds useful commands to the game such as porting to your primary home, regrouping and more.
- **Unit Frames** Custom Unitframes for Player/Target, Group, Raid, and Bosses. Color group and raid frames by Class or Role, track power changes, armor changes, and dots with animations on the frame.

Initially this [Elder Scrolls Online][1] addon was based partially on the [LUI][2] addon by LoPony and some features of [Foundry Tactical Combat][3] addon.

## Information
[Massive spreadsheet tracking for Buff/Debuff issues present here.][4]
Goal is for this spreadsheet to also serve as a modders resource, and a bug tracker for inconsistencies with abilities in the game to report to Zenimax.
