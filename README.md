# Lui-Extended

Lui Extended contains several separated addon components: unit frames, lightweight information panel, scrolling floating combat text, active effects tracker, simple damage meter and additional chat announcement module.
Initially this addon was based partially on [LUI](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info413-LUI.html) addon by LoPony and some features of [Foundry Tactical Combat](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info28-FoundryTacticalCombat.html) addon.


Utilizing GitHub to attempt to keep a transparent and organized workflow.
Feel free to contribute ideas on esoUI and I'll add them into potential projects or issues!

Current project goals:

Short term - Clean up minor issues with the UI, add better customization options for size of custom unit frames, buff tracker, and combat text.

Long term - Using custom overides, complete replacement of icons for abilities used in the game that currently do not have icons - as well as fixing placeholder or pointless buffs to no longer display and fixing buffs that currently do not have an aura to display. Integration with CombatCloud and plugin for CombatMetrics.

[Massive spreadsheet tracking for Buff/Debuff issues present here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YOCz2ESzmdcs-QZ4whVNtcFDtcglpbiv-VYxUhZHGpk/edit#gid=709796411)
Goal is for this spreadsheet to also serve as a modders resource, and a bug tracker for inconsistencies with abilities in the game to report to Zenimax.

Lui code is intended to be open source. Feel free to suggest or make contributions!
You are welcome to copy and edit any code and features as long as they are not sections tagged as pulled from another addon.
