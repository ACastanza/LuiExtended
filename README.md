# Lui-Extended

CHANGELOG:

1-28-17:

- Initial Upload complete for BETA version 

- LootLog update (by psypanda)
    - Added Setting "Show only notable self Loot" (Idea and some code stolen from LootLog - thanks!)
    - Added Setting "Show Item Trait" (Idea and some code stolen from LootLog - thanks!)
    - Added Setting "Timestamp Format" (CreateTimestamp() function borrowed from pChats - thanks!)
    - Changed the color code of the Timestamp to match pChats default
    - Changed printToChat() function (Still left old one commented out)
    - Fixed missing Timestamp on group join/leave events
    - Added a small Blacklist for LootLog to hide certain annoying items to prevent chat spam. (In the future we could create a setting for each one of them if needed)


Lui code is intended to be open source. Feel free to suggest or make contributions!
You are welcome to copy and edit any code and features as long as they are not sections tagged as pulled from another addon.
